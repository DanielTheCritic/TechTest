# CSV File Analyzer

A small desktop application written in C# that uses CSVs with the headers FirstName, LastName, Address and PhoneNumber.
It processes the contents of the CSV file and exports them into 2 files that contain the following:
- A list of names ordered descending by the number of occurrances in a file. This applies to both first and last names.
  Subsequently the names are ordered alphabetically.
- A list of addresses ordered alphabetically by street.
